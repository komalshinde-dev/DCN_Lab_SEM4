# DCN-Lab-Sem4

This repository contains assignments for the Data Communication and Computer Networks lab, focused on practical implementation of networking concepts such as LAN/WAN setup, socket programming, error handling, routing algorithms, and traffic analysis using tools like Packet Tracer, Wireshark, and Python.

## Lab Assignments

- **WiredLAN/**: Basic LAN setup and PING testing
- **TopologyTracer/**: Design and simulate different topologies in Packet Tracer
- **WAN_WLAN/**: Integration of wired and wireless LAN in a WAN setup
- **ErrorDetection/**: Hamming Code and CRC-based error correction
- **FlowControl/**: Simulate Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat protocols
- **Subnetting/**: Calculate subnet masks and subnet IP ranges
- **RoutingAlgorithms/**: Implement Dijkstra and Distance Vector protocols
- **TCPSockets/**: TCP-based client-server apps (chat, file transfer, calculator)
- **UDPSockets/**: File transfer using UDP between two systems
- **DNSLookup/**: Resolve domain/IP using a DNS lookup script
- **WiresharkFilters/**: Analyze network traffic with Wireshark and filters
- **ProtocolPerformance/**: Compare HTTP, HTTPS, FTP performance using Packet Tracer
- **DHCPSetup/**: Setup and configure a DHCP server to assign IPs

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Wireshark
- TCP/IP, UDP, DNS, DHCP protocols

Each folder includes implementation files, Packet Tracer diagrams, or documentation relevant to the task.
